These 4 models are used for privacy policy classification and semantic role labeling. 

- model_dr_best means that model which can classify data retention pp.
-  model_fpc_best means that model which can classify first party collection pp. 
- model_tps_best means that model which can classify third party sharing pp. 
- XML_model_srl can semantic role label the pp.
